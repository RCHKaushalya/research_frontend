## ðŸ§  What Is React Native?
React Native is a JavaScript framework that lets us build mobile apps using:
 - React (a UI library for building components)
 - Native mobile features (like camera, SMS, GPS)
 - One codebase for both Android and iOS

Instead of writing Java/Kotlin (Android) or Swift (iOS), you write JavaScript + JSX (HTML-like syntax), and React Native turns it into native mobile code.

## ðŸ§­ How Expo Router Works

 - Every file inside app/ becomes a screen
 - _layout.tsx defines the navigation structure (like stack or tabs)
 - index.tsx is your home screen (default route /)
